 CONSCRIPTS_DESC:0 "The militia of the 19th century was a volunteer military formation created in various European countries to participate in military operations. These militias were recruited from local residents who volunteered to join the army to support their country in the event of war. \n\nThe militias were formed on the basis of the territorial principle and consisted of people of different social backgrounds: peasants, workers, artisans, intellectuals and others. They were organized into companies, battalions and regiments, which were subordinate to the local military authorities. \n\nThe militias received military training and received weapons and equipment at the expense of the State or public donations. They participated in combat operations on a par with regular troops, often performing tasks related to intelligence, communications protection and other support functions. \n\nMilitias played an important role in protecting their countries from external threats, especially during the Napoleonic Wars. They demonstrated high morale, dedication to their homeland and willingness to sacrifice themselves."
 REGULAR_INFANTRY_DESC:0 "The 19th century line infantry was the main type of infantry in European land armies from the mid-17th to the mid-19th century. It consisted of two to four ranks of infantrymen lined up side by side, which maximized the effect of firepower. The line infantry served as an "anchor" for the riflemen and cavalry, providing them with shelter and the opportunity to retreat in case of a threat. \n\nThe training of the line infantry was aimed at rapid deployment in line, rapid firing and maneuvering. Weapons and equipment included bayonets for close combat and matchlock muskets for reloading. \n\nLinear tactics and function required strict discipline and practicing simple movements to automatism. During training, drill and corporal punishment were widely used."

 BRIG_DESC:0 "Brig is a two—masted vessel of the 19th century with a direct sailing armament of the foremast and mainmast. There was one oblique gaff sail on the mainmast - the mainsail-gaff-trisail. The brig had two masts and up to 28 guns, and its crew was up to 120 people. \n\nThe brig served mainly for cruising, patrol and messenger services. It was used to escort merchant ships and perform reconnaissance missions."
 MEDIUM_STEAMER_DESC:0 "Rowing steamships of the 19th century were small vessels that were used to transport goods and passengers along rivers and lakes. They were propelled by rowing wheels or oars. \n\nThe steamships were equipped with a steam engine that drove the paddle wheels or propeller. Steam engines were powered by coal or firewood and provided sufficient power to propel the ship. \n\nRowing steamships were popular in the 19th century due to their efficiency and the ability to travel long distances. They were used to transport goods, mail, passengers and troops. \n\nThe armament of the paddle steamers was minimal and consisted of light guns to protect against pirates and other vessels."
 SCREW_FRIGATE_DESC:0 "Screw frigates are a type of warships that appeared in the middle of the 19th century. They differed from previous sailing frigates by having a steam engine and a propeller instead of oars. This allowed them to develop great speed and maneuverability, as well as use a steam engine for combat. \n\nThe first screw frigates were built in Russia and Great Britain. They had a displacement of 3 to 5 thousand tons, a length of 50 to 70 meters and a speed of up to 14 knots. The armament consisted of several dozen guns of different calibers. \n\nScrew frigates were used as cruisers, scouts and patrol ships. They participated in various naval battles and expeditions, as well as performed tasks to protect the coast and escort merchant ships."

 SHIPPING_CONTROL:0 "Shipping control"
 SHIPPING_CONTROL_TEXT:0 "Shipping control is like trade power in EU4: it determines what amount of shipping in a tradezone any given country controls. \n\nYour shipping control value is the amount of shipping you can profit from (harbour fees and income from merchant spending). It is both a factor in your percentage of overall control and a cap in the amount of shipping you control. i.e. you may control 50% of 1,000 available shipping points because the shipping control in the TZ is only a total of 100, but with only 50 control you may only benefit from 50 of the 1,000 available points."
 SHIPPING_BASE:0 "Base"
 SHIPPING_BASE_TEXT:0 "Every coastal and river province provides +1 point to shipping control as a baseline."
 SHIPPING_GOVERNORSHIP_INFRASTRUCTURE_BONUS:0 "Governorship infrastructure bonus"
 SHIPPING_GOVERNORSHIP_INFRASTRUCTURE_BONUS_TEXT:0 "A bonus from the average infrastructure bonus per province in the governorship is granted to all provinces in that governorship. This is capped by the individual province's number of depot buildings."
 SHIPPING_MAJOR_PORTS:0 "Major ports"
 SHIPPING_MAJOR_PORTS_TEXT:0 "Over a certain threshold, provinces can become major ports at which point they provide much greater bonuses to shipping control."
